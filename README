This is the SA Emoticon bot.

Currently to update the store of emoticons, it takes a little bit of work.
First, you would run:
	python gen-smilies.py > smilies.py
Then you have to edit gen-smilies to not chop off the whole url and run
	python gen-smilies.py > assets/emotes/smilies.py
	python assets/emotes/download.py
Then, one of the smilies has a ~ in it which google app engine hates, so you
have to manually rename it, and edit the file name in the root smilies.py

It's a horrible hack and the next project is to make update-smilies.py
that takes care of all of this.

Also, if someone knows how to use the google data store efficiently to store
the emoticon names and paths, that would be very nice. When I tried it that way
every access was taking upwards of 600-1000ms to execute of cpu time which
sorta goes over your quota very fast.
