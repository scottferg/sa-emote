This is the SA Emoticon bot.

To update the list of smilies run:

	python update-smilies.py

And to update them and send them up to google with one command run:

	python update-smilies.py -send

Also, if someone knows how to use the google data store efficiently to store
the emoticon names and paths, that would be very nice. When I tried it that way
every access was taking upwards of 600-1000ms to execute of cpu time which
sorta goes over your quota very fast.
